Cybernews’ research, which examined over 19 billion leaked passwords between April 2024 and early 2025, further highlights:

94% of passwords were reused or duplicates.

Only 6% were unique.

Among the most frequently used passwords:

"123456" appeared approximately 338 million times.

"1234" appeared about 727 million times.

### 3. **Patterns Beyond Numbers**
Cybernews data reveals additional insights:
- **8%** of passwords included popular **names**, with **“Ana”** being especially common (~178.8 million instances).
- Positive or nostalgic words like **‘love’** (87M), **‘sun’** (34M), **‘dream’** (6.1M), **‘joy’** (6.9M), and **‘freedom’** (2M).
- Pop culture references: **“Mario”** (9.6M), **“Thor”** (6.2M), **“Batman”** (3.9M), **“Joker”** (3.1M), **“Elsa”** (2.9M).
- Profanity also featured: **“ass”** (165M), **“fuck”** (16M), **“shit”** (6.5M), **“dick”** (3.2M), **“bitch”** (3.2M). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

##  Then What Happens in a Breach?

- **Credential stuffing and dictionary attacks** exploit these predictable patterns—simple passwords like `"123456"`, `"password"`, or `"admin"` are extremely quick to breach. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- The frequent reuse of passwords means a breach of one account can compromise multiple services (the “domino effect”). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Studies show **81% of data breaches** involve weak or stolen credentials. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- Companies and users often lose significant time and money recovering from these incidents—on average, a breached account takes over **10 hours to recover** and costs **$4.35 million** per incident. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Notable Breach Examples:
- **RockYou (2009)**: Exposed over 32 million accounts, with plaintext passwords—this dataset became a popular wordlist for cracking attacks. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- **Yahoo Voices (2012)**: About 450,000 plaintext passwords were leaked via SQL injection, allowing immediate misuse. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- **LinkedIn (2012)**: Around 6.5 million passwords were stolen (later additional 100 million), prompting forced password resets. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- **Ashley Madison (2015)**: 11 million passwords were cracked; most common among the easiest-to-crack were `"123456"` and `"password"`. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- **Collection #1 (2019)**: Over 2.7 billion email/password pairs (21M unique passwords) appeared, many in plaintext. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

##  Summary: What This Means

- **Predictable, weak passwords** remain alarmingly common—even today.
- **Most popular passwords** (e.g., `"123456"`, `"password"`, `"admin"`, `"qwerty"`) are breached first—often instantly.
- **Names, pop culture references, profanity, and food or place names** are also easy to guess.
- **Reuse of these weak passwords across sites greatly amplifies breach impact**.
- **Historical breaches**—from RockYou to LinkedIn—demonstrate how plaintext or weak password s
