Password Strength Testing & Analysis Report
1. Objective
The objective of this exercise is to understand what makes a password strong, evaluate different password formats using online password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com), and determine best practices for creating secure passwords.

2. Tools Used
Password Strength Checker: passwordmeter.com

Browser: Google Chrome (for tool access)

3. Methodology
Created multiple passwords with varying complexity:

Changing length (short, medium, long)

Using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols in different combinations.

Tested each password in the tool.

Recorded score and feedback from the checker.

Analyzed results to find patterns in strength ratings.

4. Test Passwords and Results
Password	Length	Composition Used	Tool Score (%)	Feedback Summary
pass123	7	Lowercase + Numbers	35%	Too short, no symbols, weak pattern.
Password1	9	Uppercase + Lowercase + Numbers	50%	Common word, predictable.
Pa$$w0rd!	9	Uppercase + Lowercase + Numbers + Symbols	75%	Better, but based on common word.
G7#kLp2!	8	Random mix of all types	85%	Strong, but could be longer.
hT9&Lp9@qS4*	12	Uppercase + Lowercase + Numbers + Symbols	100%	Very strong, random, long.
correct horse battery staple	28	Lowercase words only	80%	Strong due to length, but no character variety.

5. Observations
Length greatly improves score, even if character variety is limited.

Mixing character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) increases strength.

Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns like Password1.

Randomness is key â€” predictable substitutions (@ for a) help only slightly.

Passphrases (long sequences of random words) can be strong if long enough.

6. Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Minimum length: 12 characters or more.

Use all character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid personal information (name, birthday, pet name).

Avoid dictionary words or common patterns.

Consider passphrases for memorability (e.g., BlueTiger!RunsFast#92).

Use a password manager for storing complex passwords.

Never reuse passwords across multiple sites.

7. Common Password Attacks
Brute Force Attack:
The attacker tries every possible combination until the correct password is found.
Defense: Use long and complex passwords.

Dictionary Attack:
The attacker uses a list of common words and phrases.
Defense: Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns.

Credential Stuffing:
Stolen credentials from one breach are used on other sites.
Defense: Never reuse passwords.

Phishing:
Trick users into revealing their password.
Defense: Always verify URLs before entering credentials.

8. How Complexity Affects Security
Short + simple passwords are vulnerable to quick brute force attacks.

Length exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, making brute force much slower.

Character variety increases complexity, reducing the success rate of dictionary attacks.

Randomness prevents attackers from predicting common substitutions.

9. Conclusion
From testing, it is clear that the strongest passwords combine long length, randomness, and a mix of character types. Passphrases can also be strong if they are long and unique. Weak passwords, even if slightly altered, remain vulnerable.
